git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment 404 errors

✅ Corrected routing paths in vercel.json:
- Removed /dist/public prefix from route destinations  
- Vercel uses distDir config, routes should be relative to that
- Assets now route correctly: /assets/* -> /assets/*
- Static files route correctly: /*.js|css -> /*
- SPA fallback routes to /index.html (not /dist/public/index.html)

🎯 This resolves the 404 errors on deployment"
